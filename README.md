# Proteomics analysis
Pathway activities in 7 tissues are analyzed using proteomics data obtained from Nie, Xiu, et al. "Multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 autopsies." Cell 184.3 (2021): 775-791.

# Code structure:
- Data folder contains proteomics data, wikipathways and COVID19 Disease Map GMT files that are needed for the analysis
- "MultiOrganProteomicFunc.R" contains custom-made functions that needed for the analysis
- "AnalysisScript.R" is the master script for the analysis

# How to run: 
- Download the code and the Data folder
- Follow the steps in the "AnalysisScript.R" to recreate the result in the paper
